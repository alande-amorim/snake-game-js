This is a really simple demo implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, JS and nothing else.
The idea of this game was taken from [Web Dev Simplified's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY) on YouTube.

You can play my version implementation demo here: https://alande-amorim.github.io/snake-game-js/

Hope you enjoy!
